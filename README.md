# Epileptic Seizures

Created a classification machine learning model that can predict whether patients are having a seizure or not through EEG readings. The classifiers that were used for this study were Na√Øve Bayes and Logistic Regression. By using the PCA method we minimized the components of the experiment and we suggested the most optimal number of components in order to succeed the highest accuracy.
